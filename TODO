Write some tests

factorize link generation in templates
(something like the link_to(url, category) I had
in rfortunes)

make fortune/random redirect to a permalink
(ala XKCD) : this way you can get back to a previous
fortune

in this case, it will be nice to have a bottom line like this:
  <<first <previous ?random next> last>>

changelog please

ansible + docker because why not?
