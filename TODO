* write a systemd unit for pyfd

* let upstart handle the change of user, the pid and so on
  (must be possible)

* git:
  * pyfd's home should not be the fortunedb dir
  * an other process (cron job?) should handle the git synchro

* choose with a higher probability the categories with more quotes
  (just looking at the file size is probably enough)
