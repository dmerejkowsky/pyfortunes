PyFortunes: XML RPC Client/Server for a fortune database
By fortune I mean http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_%28Unix%29[This software]

WARNING: This is still mostly a work in progress. Please be careful...


Description
-----------

This software is useful when you want to manage your own
fortune database.

Basically, a fortune database is just a bunch of plain text files in a directory
(e.g '/usr/share/fortune/')

Nothing prevents you from creating you own database. Just create a directory
(e.g '~/.fortune'), and put your fortunes in plain text files, separating each
fortune with +%+ on a single line.

For instance, if you want to start a collection of fortunes about famous quotes
from movies, just create a file '~/.fortune/movies' looking like

Requirements
------------

The software is written using Python3

Right now you need the fortune and stfrile executables from fortune-mod
in your PATH.

I may end up writing a Python3 only version.

Usage
-----

----
# From one shell:
pyf-srv ~/.fortune

# From other shell:

# Display a fortune at random:
pyf-get

# Add a new fortune to the database:
pyf-add


----

Note that the '.dat' file required for 'fortune' to work will be automatically
created.


Bugs
----

Probably many. Please use github bug tracker if you find one.
